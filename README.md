#Enrollment Rates in Sub-Saharan African Countries
##A Comparison of Enrollment Rates in Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Education across different African Countries

####Objectives
Education is one of the major concerns that induce inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa. With the improvements in primary education, education enrollment in general is still having a lot of issues.
This visualizaion aims at providing a broad perspective for investigating enrollment situations across different regions in SSA, as well as specific changes in the past few years within each country. 

####Special Focus 
Gender inequality is a major concern within education enrollments, and historically, females have been treated differently than males in education. I am bringing an extra perspective to compare the 
differences in enrollment rates for each gender.
