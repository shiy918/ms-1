# Enrollment Rates in Sub-Saharan African Countries
## A Comparison of Enrollment Rates in Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Education across SSA Countries

#### Objectives
Education is one of the major concerns that induce inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa. With the improvements in primary education, education enrollment in general is still having a lot of issues.
This visualizaion aims to provide a broad perspective for investigating enrollment situations across different regions in SSA, as well as specific changes in the past few years within each country. 

#### Special Focus 
Gender inequality is a major concern in education. I am bringing an extra perspective to compare the 
differences in enrollment rates of each gender.
